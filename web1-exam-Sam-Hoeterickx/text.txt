Smart care reminders
Are you not sure when it's time to water your plants? Planta knows when! Just add them to the app and get notified when it's time to water, fertilize, mist, clean (yes, it's a thing) and repot!

Plant identification
Maybe you are not sure which plant you have? You can just take a picture of it and we will instantly let you know. With Plantas plant scanner you can scan all your house plants to find out the plants name and how to care for them.

Light meter
Would you like to put a plant in a bathroom without windows? Some plants prefer shade and some are sun-lovers. Get to know which plants are suitable in your home based on the different light conditions of your rooms.

Whatever plant we got you covered!
